## Hi, I am Viviana 👋🏽 

I am a creative frontend developer, with a background in audiovisual and visual communication.

I am a collaborative team player, keen on design details and empathic with the user's perspective.

During the last few months, I have worked as a Software Engineering intern at Wikimedia Foundation (see my contributions here). I am passionate about developing enjoyable experiences that make the web more accessible and inclusive.
