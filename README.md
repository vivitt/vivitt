# Hi, I am Viviana 👋🏽 

I am a creative frontend developer, with a background in audiovisual and visual communication.

I am a collaborative team player, keen on design details and empathic with the user's perspective.
During the last few months, I have worked as a Software Engineering intern at Wikimedia Foundation (see [my contributions here](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-GrowthExperiments/commits?author=vivitt)). 

I am passionate about crafting enjoyable experiences that make the web more accessible and inclusive.

Find more about me on [my website](https://www.viviyanez.dev/) and feel free to reach out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viviana-yanez/), I am always happy to exchange experiences, learnings, and thoughts.
