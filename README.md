I am a creative developer, with a background in audiovisual and visual communication. I am passionate about crafting enjoyable experiences that make the web more accessible and inclusive.

I am currently participating as a frontend developer at [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/). Previously, I completed a Software Engineering internship at the Wikimedia Foundation. You can see [my contributions here](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-GrowthExperiments/commits?author=vivitt), find more about me on [my website](https://www.viviyanez.dev/), or reach out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viviana-yanez/). I am always happy to exchange experiences, learnings, and thoughts. 

I am open for full-time opportunities. If you are hiring, let's talk about how I can contribute to your team! I thrive in collaborative environments, and observation is my superpower. I am always open to learn new tech stacks and would absolutely love to be part of a team that conducts code reviews and follows TDD practices.
